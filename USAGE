HOW TO USE THIS CLASS

First, make an instance of the FASTAFile class. To specify a file to open, you
can either supply a filename to the constructor of the class (optional), or you
can use the open() function.
  - open() will return true or false depending on success;
  - the constructor will throw a std::runtime_error upon failure.

Next, you can use the get_sequence() function to grab a sequence of nucleotides.
This FASTA file will then extract the sequence at that start and end point,
which will ignore the first line. There is an optional third parameter which is
a bool. If true, it will return the sequence in all capitals. If false, it will
return in whatever case it's found in the file.
